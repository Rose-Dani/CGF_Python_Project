# Recipe book

As part of a python course offered by CFG, I had to create an app using APIs to retrieve recipes. The course focused on:
- data types and variables
- using methods
- using if statements
- creation of lists and dictionaries
- third party libraries and APIs
- reading and writing files

Group project description: 

One of the requirements of the course was to write an app to retrieve recipes online by using APIs. To further develop the project, I decided together with Yu-Hsuan Chen to allow the user both to enter more than one ingredient for the recipe search, and to decide among different meal type options. Moreover, we decided to display the recipes ranked by calories in ascending order. Finally, we saved for every search only the recipe with the lowest amount of calories.
For this project, whose aim was to applied all the knowledge and skills gathered through the course, we relied on the Edamam Recipe Search API. 

Any advice or suggestion to better improve the code is welcome.
